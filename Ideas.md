#UFO Game

###Basic Concept

* UFO hovers around planets
* UFO delivers resources from one planet to another to help grow a planet
* IE UFO takes fire to an ice planet to create water.  Water to a forest planet to grow trees.
* Could also bring fire to the forest planet to burn down trees.
* Planets are very small and the UFO can easily be seen flying around it.
* Items get sucked up by a ray

###Small Ideas

* The camera stays on the UFO, only the planet moves
* Planets are very small and the UFO can easily fly around the whole thing
* Planets fade and shrink if they are not taken care of and collapse
* The sun is a constant source to start from
* Human planet?
* Animal planets? Maybe plant planet -> herbavore planet -> carnivore planet
* Alien lives in a small house on one of the planets
* UFO engine starting noise
* Harvestable berries grow from bushes like inflating baloons

###Questions

* What is the main purpose of the UFO? (Escape solar system?  Planet Gardener?)
* What is the main purpose of the player?
* How is the player rewarded? (Planet size?  Planet population? Planet balance?)

###Problems to Solve/Things to Lean
* How to apply basic textures (ie land and water.) idealy with physics interaction.
* How to spin the planet with momentum
* How to spin the planer correctly.  Right now the XAxis rotation is working perfectly, but the Z axis is very wonky.  Probably going to try making the UFO actually rotate around the planet and have the camera follow.
