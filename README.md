UFOGame is a simple hobby project I started to learn some things about making games and working with 3D space.

I am planning to publish this once I develop and build out the structure and once it's a little fun.  Hopefully I reach that point.  I'm not exactly sure how to make this fun yet.  Maybe I'll keep adding ideas if I get some good ones.  Any comments or ideas on how to improve the code or the game are appreciated!
